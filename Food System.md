* Aim  
In this study, we aimed to address the abovementioned research gap by optimizing food consumption in Chinese provinces from all these ***nutritional, environmental, economic, and cultural*** (i.e., acceptability with the minimum changes) perspectives adopted the ***non-linear programming approach*** to identify sustainable diets for 31 provinces in mainland China.
* Data  
15种类 including cereals, tubers, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts, pork, beef, mutton, poultry, eggs, dairy products, fish and seafood, sugar, and oil. Due to lack of data on salt intake, we assumed a salt intake of 5 g for all provinces with no further optimization  
*away from home*, ***CHNS 2018***  
按照弹性系数比重进行估算比例 方法同《2021中国与全球食物政策报告》正式发布(附全文) https://agfep.cau.edu.cn/art/2021/4/30/art_39027_744843.html 附录2提供了弹性系数，以及计算的2012-2019的在外就餐消费比例  
$F_{ij} = \frac{h_{ij}}{(1 - r_i \cdot (1 + e_i \cdot \frac{(I_j - \bar{I})}{\bar{I}}))}$  
where Fij denotes the consumption of food item i in province j;  hij denotes the consumption; ri denotes the average proportion of out-of-home consumption in the CHNS 2018 survey provinces; ei denotes the income elasticity of the out-of-home consumption of ; Ij denotes the average income of residents; and Idenotes the average income of the CHNS 2018 survey provinces.  

*Evinronmental Footprint*: recently Chinese available (Cai et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2021) environmental footprint factors, i.e., carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF), land footprint (LF), nitrogen footprint (NF), and phosphorus footprint (PF) per gram of food to all food items. 这是目前最全面的针对中国的食物环境足迹数据
